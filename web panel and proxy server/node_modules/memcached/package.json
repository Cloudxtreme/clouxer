  "readme": "# Memcached [![Build Status](https://secure.travis-ci.org/3rd-Eden/node-memcached.png?branch=master)](http://travis-ci.org/3rd-Eden/node-memcached)\n\n`memcached` is a fully featured Memcached client for Node.js. `memcached` is\nbuilt with scaling, high availability and exceptional performance in mind. We\nuse consistent hashing to store the data across different nodes. Consistent\nhashing is a scheme that provides a hash table functionality in a way that\nadding or removing a server node does not significantly change the mapping of\nthe keys to server nodes. The algorithm that is used for consistent hashing is\nthe same as `libketama`.\n\nThere are different ways to handle errors for example, when a server becomes\nunavailable you can configure the client to see all requests to that server as\ncache misses until it goes up again. It's also possible to automatically remove\nthe affected server from the consistent hashing algorithm or provide `memcached`\nwith a failover server that can take the place of the unresponsive server.\n\nWhen these issues occur the `memcached` client will emit different events where\nyou can subscribe to containing detailed information about the issues.\n\nThe client is configurable on different levels. There's a global configuration\nthat you update so all your Memcached clusters will use the same failure\nconfiguration for example, but it's also possible to overwrite these changes per\n`memcached` instance.\n\n### protocol\n\nAs in other databases and message queues, this module uses the ASCII protocol to communicate with\nthe server, which means that you can see what is send over the wire. For debugging this is easier\nfor both the users and the developers however this also means that SASL auth is not supported\nbecause it demands the binary protocol.\n\n## Setting up the client\n\nThe constructor of the `memcached` client take 2 different arguments `server\nlocations` and `options`. Syntax:\n\n``` js\nvar Memcached = require('memcached');\nvar memcached = new Memcached(Server locations, options);\n```\n\n### Server locations\n\nThe server locations is designed to work with different formats. These formats\nare all internally parsed to the correct format so our consistent hashing scheme\ncan work with it. You can either use:\n\n1. **String**, this only works if you are running a single server instance\n   of Memcached.  It's as easy a suppling a string in the following format:\n   `hostname:port`. For example `192.168.0.102:11211` This would tell the client\n   to connect to host `192.168.0.102` on port number `11211`.\n\n2. **Array**, if you are running a single server you would only have to supply\n  one item in the array.  The array format is particularly useful if you are\n  running a cluster of Memcached servers. This will allow you to spread the keys\n  and load between the different servers. Giving you higher availability\n  when one of your Memcached servers goes down.\n\n3. **Object**, when running a cluster of Memcached servers, some servers may allocate different amounts of memory, e.g. 128, 512, and 128mb. While by default all servers are equally important and dispatch consistently the keys between the servers (33/33/33%), it is possible to send more keys in servers having more memory. To do so, define an object whose `key` represents the server location and whose value represents a server weight, the default weight for a server being 1; so, for instance `{ '192.168.0.102:11211': 1, '192.168.0.103:11211': 2, '192.168.0.104:11211': 1 }` distributes 50% of the keys on server 103, but only 25% on 104 and 25% on 102.\n\nTo implement one of the above formats, your constructor would look like this:\n\n```js\nvar memcached = new Memcached({ '192.168.0.102:11211': 1, '192.168.0.103:11211': 2, '192.168.0.104:11211': 1 });\nvar memcached = new Memcached([ '192.168.0.102:11211', '192.168.0.103:11211', '192.168.0.104:11211' ]);\nvar memcached = new Memcached('192.168.0.102:11211');\n```\n\n### Options\n\nMemcached accepts two option schemes. The first one inherits of all Memcached server instances\nwhile the second one is client specific and overwrites the globals. To define these options,\nMemcached server uses the same properties:\n\n* `maxKeySize`: *250*, the maximum key size allowed.\n* `maxExpiration`: *2592000*, the maximum expiration time of keys (in seconds).\n* `maxValue`: *1048576*, the maximum size of a value.\n* `poolSize`: *10*, the maximum size of the connection pool.\n* `algorithm`: *md5*, the hashing algorithm used to generate the `hashRing` values.\n* `reconnect`: *18000000*, the time between reconnection attempts (in milliseconds).\n* `timeout`: *5000*, the time after which Memcached sends a connection timeout (in milliseconds).\n* `retries`: *5*, the number of socket allocation retries per request.\n* `failures`: *5*, the number of failed-attempts to a server before it is regarded as 'dead'.\n* `retry`: *30000*, the time between a server failure and an attempt to set it up back in service.\n* `remove`: *false*, if *true*, authorizes the automatic removal of dead servers from the pool.\n* `failOverServers`: *undefined*, an array of `server_locations` to replace servers that fail and\n that are removed from the consistent hashing scheme.\n* `keyCompression`: *true*, whether to use `md5` as hashing scheme when keys exceed `maxKeySize`.\n* `idle`: *5000*, the idle timeout for the connections.\n\nExample usage:\n\n```js\nvar memcached = new Memcached('localhost:11211', {retries:10,retry:10000,remove:true,failOverServers:['192.168.0.103:11211']});\n```\n\nIf you wish to configure the options globally:\n\n```js\nvar Memcached = require('memcached');\n// all global configurations should be applied to the .config object of the Client.\nMemcached.config.poolSize = 25;\n```\n\n## API\n\n### Public methods\n\n**memcached.touch** Touches the given key.\n\n* `key`:

a connection for the given server. The supplied callback\nfunction will receive a reference to the connection as argument.\nIf there are issues with the server connection, we are going to respond with cache-miss pattern.\n\n* `server`: *String*, The server that needs a connection, the format must be\nconfirm the server_locations specification.\n* `callback`: *Function*, The callback function that receives the net.Stre\n\n``` js\nmemcached.connect( '192.168.0.103:11211', function( err, conn ){\n  if( err ) throw new Error( err );\n  console.log( conn.server );\n});\n```\n\n**.multi** A small wrapper function that makes it easier to query multiple Memcached\nservers. It will return the location for each key or the complete list of\nservers.\n\n* `keys`: *Array* **(optional)**, They keys that needs to be converted to a server.\n* `callback`: *Function*, The callback function for the data, it will be called\nfor **each** key. It will be called with 4 arguments:\n\n1. `server`: *String*, The server location.\n2. `key`: *String*, The key associated with the server, if you didn't specify\n   keys, this variable will be undefined.\n3. `index`: *Number*, The current index of the loop\n4. `total`: *Number*, The total amount server retrieved.\n\n``` js\nmemcached.multi( false, function( server, key, index, totals ){\n  if( err ) throw new Error( err );\n\n  this.connect( server, function( err, conn ){\n    console.log( \"connection ready\" )\n  })\n});\n```\n\n**.command** This is the core functionality of the `memcached` client. All public API's are\nrouted through this function. It takes care of the argument validations Server\nretrieval ( If the server argument isn't specified ). After all data ready a\nconnection is asked for the private `connect` method and the command is written\nto the Memcached server.\n\n* `query`: *Object*, The metaData object, see the `Callbacks` section for the\nspecification.\n* `server`: *String*, The server the to connect. This is only needed when the\nmetaData object doesn't contain a key property to retrieve the server from.\n\n``` js\nmemcached.command({\n  key: 'key', callback: function(){ console.dir( arguments ); },\n\n  // validate the arguments\n  validate: [[ 'key', String ], [ 'callback', Function ]],\n\n  // used for the query\n  type: 'delete',\n  command: 'delete key'\n});\n```\n\n**.connectionIssue** A internal function for logging issues with connections. As there can be various\nof ways that an error occurs we need solid issue manager to handle all these\ncases. For example server could crash or the Memcached server could respond with\n`SERVER ERROR <broken>`.\n\n* `error`: *String*, The actual error message.\n* `Stream`: *net.Stream*, A reference to the connection stream where the error\noccurred on.\n* `callback`: *Function* **(optional)**, The callback function of a potential\nrequest, it will be marked as cache miss if it was provided\n\n``` js\nmemcached.connectionIssue( \"Server down\", connectionReference );\n```\n\n## Callbacks\n\nEach method requires a callback function. Once this function get executed there\nwill be 2 variables applied:\n\n* `error`: A error response if something went wrong while retrieving data from\n  the Memcached server. Depending on the type of request this will either be an\n  string or an Array with multiple errors.\n* `response`: The actual result from the Memcached server. If the response is\n  `false` or `undefined` than a cache miss occurred. Cache misses will also\n  occur when there is an error. So you might want to check on errors first.\n\nWhen we have a successful response, the context of the callback function will\nshift to a metaData object. The metaData object contains all information that we\nused to generate the request for the Memcached server. The metaData object\ncontains the following properties:\n\n* `start`: Date in milliseconds when the request was received\n* `execution`: Total execution time for the request, including response parsing.\n* `callback`: Reference to the callback function\n* `type`: The type of Memcached command\n* `command`: The compiled command that was send through the sockets\n* `validate`: The properties of metaData object that needs type validation.\n\nAnd all the arguments you have send to the method, this depends on the method\nyou have called.\n\n## Events\n\nWhen connection issues occur we send out different notifications using the\n`EventEmitter` protocol. This can be useful for logging, notification and\ndebugging purposes. Each event will receive details Object containing detailed\ninformation about the issues that occurred.\n\n### Details Object\n\nThe details Object contains the various of error messages that caused, the\nfollowing 3 will always be present in all error events:\n\n* `server`: the server where the issue occurred on\n* `tokens`: a array of the parsed server string in `[port, hostname]` format.\n* `messages`: a array containing all error messages that this server received.\n  As messages are added to the array using .push(), the first issue will at the\n  beginning and the latest error at the end of the array.\n\nThe following properties depend on the type of event that is send. If we are\nstill in our retry phase the details will also contain:\n\n* `failures`: the amount of failures left before we mark the server as dead.\n* `totalFailures`: the total amount of failures that occurred on this server, as when the\n  server has been reconnected after it's dead the `failures` will be rest to\n  defaults and messages will be removed.\n\nIf the server is dead these details will be added:\n\n* `totalReconnectsAttempted`: the total reconnects we have attempted. This is\nthe success and failure combined.\n* `totalReconnectsSuccess`: the total successful reconnects we have made.\n* `totalReconnectsFailed`: the total failed reconnects we have made.\n* `totalDownTime`: the total down time that was generated. Formula: (\n  totalReconnectsFailed * reconnect_timeout ) + ( totalRetries * retry_timeout).\n\n### Events\n\nThere are `5` different events that the `memcached` client emits when connection\nissues occur.\n\n* `issue`: a issue occurred on one a server, we are going to attempt a retry next.\n* `failure`: a server has been marked as failure or dead.\n* `reconnecting`: we are going to attempt to reconnect the to the failed server.\n* `reconnected`: successfully reconnected to the memcached server.\n* `remove`: removing the server from our consistent hashing.\n\nExample implementations:\n\n```js\nvar memcached = new Memcached([ '192.168.0.102:11211', '192.168.0.103:11211' ]);\nmemcached.on('failure', function( details ){ sys.error( \"Server \" + details.server + \"went down due to: \" + details.messages.join( '' ) ) });\nmemcached.on('reconnecting', function( details ){ sys.debug( \"Total downtime caused by server \" + details.server + \" :\" + details.totalDownTime + \"ms\")});\n```\n\n# Compatibility\nFor compatibility with other [libmemcached](http://libmemcached.org/Clients.html) clients they need to have the behavior\n`ketama_weighted` set to true and the `hash` set to the same as `node-memcached`'s\n`algorithm`.\n\nDue to client dependent type flags it is unlikely that any types other than `string` will work.\n\n# Contributors\n\nThis project wouldn't be possible without the hard work of our amazing\ncontributors.
